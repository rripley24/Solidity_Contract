# Objective: 
Create and deploy smart contracts on Remix utlizing solidity and the Kovan test network via Metamask. Each contract will be different, with the first 2 dealing with deposit splits, and the last using deferred distribution. For the deferred distribution we had to use 'fakenow' in order to deploy the contract. Last, we wanted to confirm in [etherscan](https://kovan.etherscan.io/) that the contracts delpoyed and funds were deposited. 

## Contract addresses:
  - Employee one = 0xdD870fA1b7C4700F2BD7f44238821C26f7392148
  - Employee two = 0x583031D1113aD414F02576BD6afaBfb302140225
  - Employee three = 0x4B0897b0513fdC7C541B6d9D7E929C4e5364D2dB
  - Javascript account = 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4
  - Kovan test account = 0xe219b09a720260EDF5b756dEB3287ce4D7Aa7C28
  
# Outcome:

Please see attached text files for the code used to deploy the contracts. Below you will see screen shots of completed transactions via [etherscan](https://kovan.etherscan.io/).
